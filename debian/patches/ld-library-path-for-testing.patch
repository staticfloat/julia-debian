Description: Use correct dynamic loading path when running tests
 When Julia is compiled with MULTIARCH_INSTALL=1, the libraries are still under
 usr/lib in the build directory. Hence they cannot be found when Julia is run
 in place, for example when running the tests. This patch forces the right path
 by using LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
