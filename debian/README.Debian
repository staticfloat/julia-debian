Julia for Debian
----------------

Simply type `julia' in a shell to launch an interactive Julia session.

Full documentation and examples are available in the julia-doc package.

An Emacs mode for editing Julia source files and managing interactive sessions
is available in the ess package.

The web interface is not packaged for the time being, because it is still
experimental and can potentially create important security issues.
